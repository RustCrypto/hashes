Pure Rust implementation of the [SHA-1 hash function][1].

[Documentation][docs-link]

## ðŸš¨ Warning: Cryptographically Broken ðŸš¨

The SHA-1 hash function should be considered cryptographically broken and
unsuitable for further use in any security critical capacity, as it is
[practically vulnerable to chosen-prefix collisions][2].

We provide this crate for legacy interoperability purposes only.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.41** or higher.

Minimum supported Rust version can be changed in the future, but it will be
done with a minor version bump.
