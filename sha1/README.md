Pure Rust implementation of the [SHA-1] cryptographic hash algorithm.

## ðŸš¨ Warning: Cryptographically Broken! ðŸš¨

The SHA-1 hash function should be considered cryptographically broken and
unsuitable for further use in any security critical capacity, as it is
[practically vulnerable to chosen-prefix collisions][1].

We provide this crate for legacy interoperability purposes only.

## Examples

### One-shot API

```rust
use hex_literal::hex;
use sha1::{Sha1, Digest};

let result = Sha1::digest(b"hello world");
assert_eq!(result, hex!("2aae6c35c94fcfb415dbe95f408b9ce91ee846ed"));
```

### Incremental API

```rust
use hex_literal::hex;
use sha1::{Sha1, Digest};

let mut hasher = Sha1::new();
hasher.update(b"hello world");
let hash = hasher.finalize();

assert_eq!(hash, hex!("2aae6c35c94fcfb415dbe95f408b9ce91ee846ed"));
```

Also, see the [examples section] in the RustCrypto/hashes readme.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.71** or higher.

Minimum supported Rust version can be changed in the future, but it will be
done with a minor version bump.
