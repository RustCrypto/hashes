Pure Rust implementation of the [MD5] cryptographic hash algorithm.

## ⚠️ Security Warning

This crate is provided for the purposes of legacy interoperability with
protocols and systems which mandate the use of MD5.

However, MD5 is [cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use][1].

Collision attacks against MD5 are both practical and trivial, and
[theoretical attacks against MD5's preimage resistance have been found][2].

[RFC 6151] advises no new IETF protocols can be designed MD5-based constructions,
including HMAC-MD5.

## Examples

```rust
use md5::{Md5, Digest};
use hex_literal::hex;

let mut hasher = Md5::new();
hasher.update(b"hello world");
let hash = hasher.finalize();

assert_eq!(hash, hex!("5eb63bbbe01eeed093cb22bb8f5acdc3"));
```

Also, see the [examples section] in the RustCrypto/hashes readme.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.72** or higher.

Minimum supported Rust version can be changed in the future, but it will be
done with a minor version bump.

## SemVer Policy

- All on-by-default features of this library are covered by SemVer
- MSRV is considered exempt from SemVer as noted above
