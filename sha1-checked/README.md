Pure Rust implementation of the [SHA-1] cryptographic hash algorithm with collision detection.

## ðŸš¨ Warning: Cryptographically Broken! ðŸš¨

The SHA-1 hash function should be considered cryptographically broken and
unsuitable for further use in any security critical capacity, as it is
[practically vulnerable to chosen-prefix collisions][1].

But, this crate provides the detection [algorithm] pioneered by git, to detect hash collisions when they
occur and prevent them. The [paper] has more details on how this works.

This implementation will be slower to use than the pure SHA-1 implementation, as it has to do more computations and
it can not rely on hardware acceleration available on some CPUs.

## Examples

### One-shot API

```rust
use hex_literal::hex;
use sha1_checked::Sha1;

let result = Sha1::try_digest(b"hello world");
assert_eq!(result.hash().as_ref(), hex!("2aae6c35c94fcfb415dbe95f408b9ce91ee846ed"));
assert!(!result.has_collision());
```

### Incremental API

```rust
use hex_literal::hex;
use sha1_checked::{Sha1, Digest};

let mut hasher = Sha1::new();
hasher.update(b"hello world");
let result = hasher.try_finalize();

assert_eq!(result.hash().as_ref(), hex!("2aae6c35c94fcfb415dbe95f408b9ce91ee846ed"));
assert!(!result.has_collision());
```

Also, see the [examples section] in the RustCrypto/hashes readme.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.72** or higher.

Minimum supported Rust version can be changed in the future, but it will be
done with a minor version bump.
