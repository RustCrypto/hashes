Pure Rust implementation of the [Shabal][1] cryptographic hash algorithm.

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About 
There are 5 standard algorithms specified in the Shabal standard:

* `Shabal192`, which is the `Shabal` algorithm with the result truncated to 192 bits
* `Shabal224`, which is the `Shabal` algorithm with the result truncated to 224 bits
* `Shabal256`, which is the `Shabal` algorithm with the result truncated to 256 bits.
* `Shabal384`, which is the `Shabal` algorithm with the result truncated to 384 bits.
* `Shabal512`, which is the `Shabal` algorithm with the result not truncated.

There is a single Shabal algorithm. All variants have different intialisation and apart
Shabal512 truncate the result.

## Usage

```rust
use shabal::{Shabal256, Digest};

// create a Shabal256 hasher instance
let mut hasher = Shabal256::new();

// process input message
hasher.input(b"helloworld");

// acquire hash digest in the form of GenericArray,
// which in this case is equivalent to [u8; 32]
let result = hasher.result();
assert_eq!(result[..], hex!("d945dee21ffca23ac232763aa9cac6c15805f144db9d6c97395437e01c8595a8"));
```

## Minimum Supported Rust Version
