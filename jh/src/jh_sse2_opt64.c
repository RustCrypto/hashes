/*This program gives the optimized SSE2 bitslice implementation of JH for 64-bit platform (with 16 128-bit XMM registers).

   --------------------------------
   Performance

   Microprocessor: Intel CORE 2 processor (Core 2 Duo Mobile T6600 2.2GHz)
   Operating System: 64-bit Ubuntu 10.04 (Linux kernel 2.6.32-22-generic)
   Speed for long message:
   1) 19.9 cycles/byte   compiler: Intel C++ Compiler 11.1   compilation option: icc -O3
   2) 20.9 cycles/byte   compiler: gcc 4.4.3                 compilation option: gcc -msse2 -O3

   --------------------------------
   Compare with the original JH sse2 code (October 2008) for 64-bit platform, we made the modifications:
   a) The Sbox implementation follows exactly the description given in the document
   b) Data alignment definition is improved so that the code can be compiled by GCC, Intel C++ compiler and Microsoft Visual C compiler
   c) Using y0,y1,..,y7 variables in Function F8 for performance improvement (local variable in function F8 so that compiler can optimize the code easily)
   d) Removed a number of intermediate variables from the program (so as to given compiler more freedom to optimize the code)
   e) Using "for" loop to implement 42 rounds (with 7 rounds in each loop), so as to reduce the code size.
