Pure Rust implementation of the [JH] cryptographic hash function.

There are 4 standard versions of the JH hash function:

* JH-224
* JH-256
* JH-384
* JH-512

## Examples

```rust
use jh::{Digest, Jh256};
use hex_literal::hex;

let mut hasher = Jh256::new();
hasher.update(b"hello");
let hash = hasher.finalize();

assert_eq!(hash, hex!("94fd3f4c564957c6754265676bf8b244c707d3ffb294e18af1f2e4f9b8306089"));

// Hex-encode hash using https://docs.rs/base16ct
let hex_hash = base16ct::lower::encode_string(&hash);
assert_eq!(hex_hash, "94fd3f4c564957c6754265676bf8b244c707d3ffb294e18af1f2e4f9b8306089");
```

Also, see the [examples section] in the RustCrypto/hashes readme.
