Pure Rust implementation of the [GOST R 34.11-94] cryptographic hash algorithm.

## Examples

```rust
use gost94::{Gost94CryptoPro, Digest};
use hex_literal::hex;

let mut hasher = Gost94CryptoPro::new();
hasher.update("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog");
let hash = hasher.finalize();

assert_eq!(hash, hex!("9004294a361a508c586fe53d1f1b02746765e71b765472786e4770d565830a76"));
```

Also, see the [examples section] in the RustCrypto/hashes readme.

## Associated OIDs.
There can be a confusion regarding OIDs associated with declared types.
According to the [RFC 4357], the OIDs 1.2.643.2.2.30.1 and 1.2.643.2.2.30.0 are used to identify the hash function parameter sets (CryptoPro vs Test ones).
According to [RFC 4490] the OID 1.2.643.2.2.9 identifies the GOST 34.311-95 (former GOST R 34.11-94) function, but then it continues that this function MUST be used only with the CryptoPro parameter set.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.71** or higher.

Minimum supported Rust version can be changed in the future, but it will be
done with a minor version bump.

## SemVer Policy

- All on-by-default features of this library are covered by SemVer
- MSRV is considered exempt from SemVer as noted above
